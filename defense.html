<h1> Defense 1-on-1 </h1>
<p>  Where possible, pick a player with similar skill or points level. If defending faster/better player, try to switch with matching player with in your team as soon as possible.
</p>
<h3> Positioning </h3>
<li>Position inside of offencive player. Ie defender closer to basket than attacker. </li>
<li>Have your back to the Basket and point slightly away from attacker </li>

<p> While defending you are protecting the basket and pushing attacker away from it. By committing to inside of attacker, you make clear that only option is to move wide. You are unlikely to stop a moving player on the spot, so point chair towards a point where you are likely to intercept. </p>

<h3> Re-Positioning </h3>
It is possible that attacker fakes and moves towards back of your chair. If this happens, turn towards basket (or away from attacker) and reposition at lower point where you can intercept. If unable to defend or struggling, call for help to close the gap.
<li>Always turn away/in to basket side than move chair backwards </li>
<li>If turn towards player, you are likely to end up behind attacker. </li>
<li> Better to lose some distance than lose player completely.</li>
<li> <b>Do call out what is happening so team mates are aware </b></li>
