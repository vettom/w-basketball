 <p>Planning stage starts as soon as you turn towards opposition basket. By the time you reach halfway line you should see your options available for setting up. </p>
<h4> Starting </h4>
<li>Look for any opposition player you can pick out or slow down </li>
<li>Identify the defender to target based on their game </li>
<li>Understand defence pattern like, guarding key, push out, high line etc </li>
<li>Where is faster, taller defender positioned. </li>
<li>Always play as pair </li>

<h4>Create distance between defenders, ideally  set pick on defender with back to you. </h4>

<h3> When key is defended </h3>
