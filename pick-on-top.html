<h1> Pick on Top aka 3 on 2 </h1> 
<p> Pick on top can be a 2-on-1 move, however more effective if executed as 3-on-2 as it creates more space and options. Move starts with screen roll or a Pick-N-roll setup.
</p>
<h3> Setting it up </h3>
<li>Player on top, keeps defender engaged.  </li>
<li>Ideally Defender on top should have back to the action. (Direction pick going to come from) </li>
<li>Enough gap for pick to move in </li>
<li>Player on top having ball will help to keep Defender's attention </li>
<h3> Trigger </h3>
<li>Pick or Shooter moves up to pick for player on top </li>
<li>Second player move towards baseline taking Defender with them to create space. </li>
<li>Player on top, moves in the direction of <b>Pick </b> without leaving space for Defender to come through </li>
<li>Pass ball to who ever is in best position to take shot </li>
<li> </li>
