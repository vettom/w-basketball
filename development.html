<img src="images/smart-goals.jpg" alt="images/smart-goals.jpg" style="float: center; width:600px;height:400px;">
 <p>Evey player knows that they have to improve, however it is not easy to improve everything at a time. Hence the need for setting SMART goals for individuals, it can be set by Coach or even by yourself. </p>

<h4> SMART Goals for players</h4> 
<li> <b> Specific </b> : Target specific areas like wheelchair skills, shooting, handling, burst speed etc </li>
<li> <b>Measurable</b> : Have baseline and measure progress for example shooting percentage in the key, outside key. Travel speed with/without ball etc. </li>
<li> <b>Achievable </b> : Small goals like 2% improvement in shooting from key</li>
<li> <b>Realistic</b>  : Is it realistic to achieve the goals in specified time frame? Are you able to spend time training for it?</li>
<li> <b>Timely</b> : 5% layup score improvement by end of month, or 3 tenth faster in by end of 3 months .</li>

<h3>Baseline / Measurable metrics </h3>
<p> Before setting the Goals, you must know your current performance. So it is critical to have baseline measurements before you start working on improvement goals.

  <ul>
    Consider following while setting up baseline
    <li>Must record specifics of measurements so it can be accurately repeated </li>
    <li>Ideally take an average out of 3 repeat performances. </li>
    <li>Good to have long term Target as well as short term Goals. Eg: Shooting from key Target 70+% in 2 years, Goal of 40+% in 3 months </li>
    <li> </li>
    <li> </li>
  </ul>
