 <h1> Options when you are picked out </h1>
 <p>  It is common for a player to be picked out away from Basket, specially when returning to defend. Some of these could not be avoided, however good to have a plan for when you are picked out.
  <li>Avoid being picked out on sidelines as player can block you in</li>
  <li>If picked out near side line, try to move towards the middle. </li>
   <img src="images/pick-back.png" alt="pick-back.png" style="float: right; width:200px;height:200px; margin-left:15px;">
  <li>When you are picked out, look for any opposition player lower than you and pick on them. You will lose against 2 players however another player coming down to pick for them will cost them seconds, or sometimes you slow 2 players. </li>
  <li>When picked out, if there is a player with the ball, try to pick on them, likely to be an easier pick.</li>



 <h4> Call for help </h4>
  <li>Shout to team for help and move the player to allow pick </li>
  <li>Offence or defence, it is better for your player to be inside (near basket), so turn the player towards the line if possible. </li>
  <li>When pick is set, turn towards the pick to clear the player, ensuring not enough gap for offensice player to come through </li>
  <li>Ideally work with the pick to keep the player behind rather than leaving the pick to deal with the player. </li>

<h4> What if no help coming </h4>
  <li>If no help coming, keep moving the chair and try to keep the player engaged to use up seconds </li>
  <li>Look for turn over ball and possibility of fast break since you are already out of defence </li>
  <li>Or pick on similar level player and create man-out play for team. </li>
