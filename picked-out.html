  To be where you have never been before, you have to do what you have never done before! Some of these could not be avoinded, however good to have a plan fgor when you are picked out.
  <li>Avoid being picked out on sidelines as player can block you in</li>
  <li>If picked out near side line, try to move towards middle. </li>
  <li>When you are picked out, look for any opposition player lower than you and pick on them. You will lose against 2 players however another player coming down to pick for them will cost them seconds, or sometimes you slow 2 playes. </li>
  <li>When picked out, if there is player with ball, try pick on them, likely to be easier pick.</li>


 <h4> Call for help </h4>
  <li>Shout to team for help and move the player to allow pick </li>
  <li>Offence or defense, it is better for your player to be inside (near basket), so turn player towards line if possible. </li>
  <li>When pick is set, turn towards the pick to clear the player, ensuring not enough gap for offensice player to come through </li>
  <li>Ideally work with the pick to keep player behind than leaving pick to deal with player. </li>

<h4> What if no help coming </h4>
  <li>If no help coming, keep moving the chair and try to keep the player engaged to use up seconds </li>
  <li>Look for turn over ball and possibility of fast break since you are alredy out of defense </li>
  <li>Or pick on similar level player and create man-out play for team. </li>
