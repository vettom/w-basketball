# Pick-N-Roll vs Screen Role

Pick-N-Roll vs Screen Role are two ways of achieving 2-on-1 situations. Though similar in principle, execution is completely different. There are 4 stages in achieving a successful move. Screen-roll is a more natural progression of movement and easier for players to understand and execute.

## What is the difference
Difference is in the player movement. In a Screen-roll, Shooter moves ahead of defender coming to pick. In Pick-N-Roll, Shooter moves  in the direction of the pick.

# Screen Roll
Shooter positions behind Pick far enough away to ensure Defender jumping will pass the Pick. Shooter prepares to take shot. Defender moves out to stop the shot. Shooter ***moves ahead of defender, blocking the defender*** Point Guard/Pick ensures defender cannot return to position and moves in opposite direction. This is very natural movement and easier to pull off. In this scenario, Shooter is often closer to Pick and gap not wide enough for defender to get through.


# Advantages of Screen-Roll
- Shooter positions behind the screen, increasing chance of making shot
- Natural for Shooter to move away from Defender
- Easier and natural for pick to block Defender 
- Less space for Defender to escape
